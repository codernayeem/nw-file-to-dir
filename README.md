# File To Dir
*Automate your file **copying** or **moving** task easily.*

This software is made with **PyQt5** and **fbs**.

# Features :
  - Here you can automate your file **copying** or **moving** task.
  - You can give **condition** on which file will go to action in 2 ways :
    1. **Only Allow System** :100: : Here, you can set condition like matched extension,  contain a text etc. This system will only allow files, if they passed these condition.
    2. **Ignore System** :100:  : Here, you can set condition just like Only Allow System. This system will ignore files, if they passed these condition.
  - You will see which file is **copying or moving** / **failed** / **not allowed** / **ignored** in real time.

Just select your folders , set your output directory and check the include subfolder checkbox if you want it and then boom :+1:
